## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE}
print(cars)
library(plotly)
plot_ly(cars, x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(cars, x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
